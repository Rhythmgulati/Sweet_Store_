## 🤖 Use of AI in this Project

I have used AI tools in the following ways, keeping usage neutral and transparent:

- **Code Assistance:** To generate boilerplate code (e.g., controllers, routes, Redux slices).  
- **Debugging Support:** To understand errors and suggest possible fixes.  
- **Documentation:** To refine explanations, improve formatting, and structure this README.  
- **Best Practices:** To get guidance on project structure, commit conventions, and setup instructions.  

All final logic, integrations, and design decisions were implemented and verified by me.

📌 *This README was originally written by me and later refined with the help of AI tools.*

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
- A great thanks to **GitHub Copilot** for providing coding suggestions during development.  
- Thanks to **AI assistants (like ChatGPT)** for helping speed up boilerplate generation and documentation improvements.
